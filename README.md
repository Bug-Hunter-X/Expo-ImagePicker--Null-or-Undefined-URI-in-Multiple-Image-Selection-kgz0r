# Expo ImagePicker: Null or Undefined URI in Multiple Image Selection

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo ImagePicker library where, when selecting multiple images, some images in the `response.assets` array may have a `null` or `undefined` `uri` property. This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior in your application.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run the `bug.js` file.
2. Select multiple images using the ImagePicker.
3. Observe that some images might have a `null` or `undefined` `uri`.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to this problem by adding a check for the presence of the `uri` before accessing it. This prevents crashes and ensures robust handling of the ImagePicker results.

## Additional Notes

This bug seems to be intermittent and its exact cause is not yet fully understood. The solution provided is a workaround that handles the unexpected null or undefined values gracefully.
