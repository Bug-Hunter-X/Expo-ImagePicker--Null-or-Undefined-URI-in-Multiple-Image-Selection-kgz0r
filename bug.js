This error occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library and selecting multiple images.  The issue arises when attempting to access the `uri` property of the selected images within the `response.assets` array.  Some images might have a `uri` that is unexpectedly null or undefined, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.  This can be intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently.
